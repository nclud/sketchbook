    <p>As the world’s best-selling commercial language education software, Rosetta Stone has been giving learners the opportunity to master new languages for almost twenty years. Using immersive learning as opposed to traditional grammar-based/translation methods, the software has been awarded educational and learning awards since its initial release and is widely considered to be the gold standard for language software. Originally distributed as a box set of CDs with software, Rosetta Stone is pushing forward into a new age with subscription-based online learning and mobile experiences for a new generation of learners. Along with this push, they were looking for new ways to engage a younger, more smartphone-friendly demographic via a mobile website design that takes advantage of engaging interactions, videos, and live demos to show insights into Rosetta Stone’s key product differentiators.</p>

    <h2>Initial Concept</h2>

    <p>The strategy behind the completely redesigned mobile site was to move away from the traditional “yellow box CD-ROM” company and instead showcase a future-looking learn-anywhere software service. After all, Rosetta Stone has been acquiring other language companies, rolling out new digital products and services, and is available on mobile and tablet devices around the world.</p>

    <p>With that in mind, the site concept was built around the idea of using mobile interactions and gestures as an engagement feature, not simply as a way to navigate. Incorporating immersive images and videos allows the site to serve rich, interactive storytelling on the go (as well as act as a destination for those looking to purchase the software, of course). These features were broken down to target the two types of users visiting the site: the one wanting to learn more about the product on their phone, and the potential buyer just trying to jump right in and make a purchase.</p>

    <p>From the beginning of the concept phase, we viewed working with the Rosetta Stone team as a creative partnership, without the usual client/agency divide. We used an iterative and idea-driven process – brainstorms, napkin sketches, rough wireframes, paper prototypes – as a way to reach the goals of the content requirements and the creative brief without getting bogged down too deep in design or building. This allowed us to shape the overall interactive strategy just as much as the design and development as we continued working on the site.</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>

        <p>Since the site would be pushing Rosetta Stone forward into a bleeding-edge experience, the design worked to bring in more of the brand’s vibrant identity. Using the brand’s oranges, blues, and grays, as well as textures and patterns, the site clearly communicated that it was part of the Rosetta Stone family without overwhelming them with the “yellow box.” By choosing large, bright hero images throughout the design an emotional narrative emerged for users to connect with as they browsed – and encouraged them to delve deeper into the site. In this same vein, we opened the design up so it was less contained, allowing the information to flow easily and intuitively without literally boxing everything inside a tight grid.</p>

        <p>Even though it’s a mobile site, we wanted to stay away from any ideas of “tabbed” navigation, as can be standard on native mobile applications. Instead, we used an unobtrusive sticky menu at the top of the page that stayed with users throughout their scrolling so that they could easily access any page. With the goal of featuring the products and their features and inspiring users to explore content, horizontal swiping within sections became a secondary form of navigation. Utilizing the full features of a touch device, users were able to simply swipe across a section or hero image to dive deeper into the content and features associated with it. </p>

        <h2>Development</h2>

        <p>We approached development with the intention to bust the myth that users don’t want full access and functionality of a desktop site – they want to be able to do the same things and have the full experience, just optimized for a mobile interface and data speeds. Our goal was thus to keep each page load smaller than one megabyte and have pages load in less than five seconds each, so that those with cellular connections would still be able to easily and quickly explore the site. We also wanted to avoid replicating native functionality built into mobile browsers (as they tend to take up valuable screen real estate), so didn’t try to fit “back” buttons into the design.</p>

        <p>An interesting development dilemma arose when the site was launching: the impending release of iOS 7. With its latest operating system upgrade, Apple implemented an edge-swipe gesture to mobile Safari that acted as a forward/back history navigation function. With the wide variety of smartphones and mobile browsers out there, it was certainly not a dealbreaker, but an interesting conundrum. Do we remove the functionality entirely? Change the whole explorative nature of the gesture? In the end, we decided to keep the horizontal swiping in place, while doubling down on the functionality and usefulness of the top sticky navigation to ensure that all users were able to access and interact with the entire site.</p>

        <h2>The Shopping Cart</h2>

        <p class="rosetta_cart-caption" id="rosetta_caption1">One of the biggest ideas we strived to introduce with the new mobile site was an efficient and intuitive shopping cart for users. We conducted extensive user research and multiple design iterations with the goal to reduce time-to-checkout and make the entire process easy to navigate and complete. </p>

        <p class="rosetta_cart-caption" id="rosetta_caption2">With the introduction of the new Rosetta Stone products, the initial hurdle was showing the difference between the physical products, the CD-ROM software, vs their digital offering, TOTALe (the online subscription service and app component). Illustrating the features and end value to the customer at an initial phase was crucial to them understanding what they were actually purchasing.</p>

        <p class="rosetta_cart-caption" id="rosetta_caption3">The next question that arose was whether customers picked their language or their product first. User testing showed that users often thought that different languages had different products, complicating the purchase. With that in mind, the checkout process was approached from a product-first approach, having customers pick the product before choosing their language, essentially equating the language choice with choosing the color of your new shirt while shopping.</p>

        <p class="rosetta_cart-caption" id="rosetta_caption4">The final problem to solve was the labeling of the shopping cart itself. Using “Buy Now” language as a call to action intimidated shoppers and made them think that they were skipping right to checkout, as opposed to simply adding it to their shopping cart. Simply changing that language to “Shop Now” encouraged customers to use the call to action, add products to their carts, and check out.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Users immediately loved the redesign, with most stating that they found it easy to navigate, attractive, and clean. They were easily able to understand the teaching methodology and the difference in products even in the condensed space of the mobile format. This led to a revenue per visit increase of 21% for the new site over the old mobile site – a staggering increase for the redesign and a conversion rate well above expected for such transactions.</p>

    <p>Within Rosetta Stone, the launch of the new mobile website was highly anticipated. From the marketing team to senior executives, the entire company couldn’t wait to go live from the moment they first saw the new designs. In addition to the excitement about the new design, working together helped Rosetta Stone craft their overall mobile identity and how they portray themselves in the digital space. Reinvigorated by the site’s launch and successful reception, they are determined to provide their users the best possible site experience, no matter what platform they're using.</p>
