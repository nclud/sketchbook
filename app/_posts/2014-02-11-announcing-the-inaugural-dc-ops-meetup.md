Hello DC!

It gives me great pleasure to announce the first ever DC Ops Meetup hosted at nclud in partnership with fedscoop and open to any and all people interested in learning from one another about how to operate a small to medium size business. Yes... "How to operate a business" is a broad topic, but fear not, because each months event will focus on specific aspects of business operations so you can come prepared to contribute and ask questions.

**Who started the DC Ops Meetup?**
Well, I started it, <a href="https://twittermintue.com/joecorbett" target="_blank" />@joecorbett </a>, a.k.a. <a href="http://sketchbook.nclud.com/joe-corbett/" target="_blank"/>the COO of nclud</a>, a.k.a. that <a href="http://randomnerds.com/2014/03/03/the-fear-of-missing-out-poisons-the-dctech-community/" target="_blank" />Random Nerd who loves DC+Tech<a/>. Additionally, our partners at fedscoop, Goldy Kamali and Greg Poersch, will leverage their expertise in programing professional development oriented events to make DC OPs Meetup that much better.

**Why did you start the DC Ops Meetup?**
The reason I started the DC Ops Meetup is rather simple. Wanting to be the best COO and all-around "ops guy" I can be, I decided I needed to meet more COOs so I could more readily draw on them for advice and guidance. So, I started a meetup where operations minded people of all kind could meet and learn from each other.

**Who should attend the DC Ops Meetup?**
Anyone intereted in learning how to operate small to medium business and/or anyone that already knows a lot about doing just that and is willing to contribute should attend. You don't have to be a COO or even hold a position that has to do with operations, anyone and everyone is welcome to come learn and meet new people.

**Why is this a paid event?**
Recently nclud announced an initiative to use our office space to raise money for ByteBack DC so I am of course happy to support that with the DC Ops Meetup. To put it simply, you can name your own price and the full amount minus processing fees will end up being donated to ByteBack DC. <a href="http://sketchbook.nclud.com/byte-back/" target+"_blank" ?>You can read the full annoucement here<a/>.

**What's with the skunk holding a rocket launcher?**
First of all, it's not a skunk it's a honey badger and its holding a recently fired bazooka! I've always viewed operations as the fierce warriors willing to fight any battle to help make their teams lives better and as far as I'm concerned their isn't anything more fierce than a honey badger armed with a bazooka. Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/redtablepress" target="_blank" />@redtablepress</a> for coming up with the orginal design.

**Stickers?**
Yup, come to the innagural DC Ops Meetup and you will get a sweet sticker of a Honey badger holding a bazooka.

**Want to be a speaker or program a panel?**
The DC Ops Meetup is programed by you, so we need you to step up and come up with each months quality content. If you think you have something you'd like to speak about or you want us to hustle to find someone that does fill out this form.
