Hello DC!

It gives me great pleasure to announce the first ever DC Ops Meetup hosted at nclud and open to any and all people interested in learning from one another about how to operate a small to medium size business. Yes... "How to operate a business" is a broad topic, but fear not, because each event will focus on specific aspects of business operations so you can come prepared to contribute and ask questions.

**Who started the DC Ops Meetup?**
Well, I started it, <a href="https://twittermintue.com/joecorbett" target="_blank" />@joecorbett </a>, a.k.a. <a href="http://sketchbook.nclud.com/joe-corbett/" target="_blank"/>the COO of nclud</a>, a.k.a. <a href="http://inthecapital.streetwise.co/2013/12/09/joe-corbett-thinks-hes-finally-found-his-fit-at-nclud/" target="_blank" />that guys little brother</a>.

**Why did you start the DC Ops Meetup?**
The reason I started the DC Ops Meetup is rather simple. Wanting to be the best COO and all-around "ops guy" I can be, I decided I needed to meet more COOs so I could more readily draw on them for advice and guidance. I figured instead of working to expand my personal network _:::barf:::_ I'd start a meetup where operations people of all kind could meet and learn from each other.

**Who should attend the DC Ops Meetup?**
Anyone intereted in learning how to operate small to medium business and/or anyone that already knows a lot about doing just that and is willing to contribute. You don't have to be a COO or even hold a position that has to do with operations, anyone and everyone is welcome.

**Where do I go to become a member of DC Ops Meetup?**
You'd head on over to the Meetup.com and join the offical DC Ops Meetup.

**Why is this a paid event?**
Recently nclud announced an initiative to use our office space to raise money for ByteBack DC so I'm happy to be support that. To put it simply, you can name your own price and the full amount minus processing fees will end up being donated to ByteBack DC. You can read the full annoucement here.

**What's with the skunk holding a rocket launcher?**
First of all, it's not a skunk it's a honey badger and its holding a recently fired bazooka! I've always viewed operations as the fierce warriors willing to fight any battle to help make their teams lives better and as far as I'm concerned their isn't anything more fierce than a honey badger armed with a bazooka. Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/redtablepress" target="_blank" />@redtablepress</a> for coming up with the orginal design.

**Stickers?**
Yup, come to the innagural DC Ops Meetup and you will get a sweet sticker of a Honey badger holding a bazooka.
