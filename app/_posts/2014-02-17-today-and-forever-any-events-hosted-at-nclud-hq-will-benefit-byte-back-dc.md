Starting today, nclud will ask all event organizers seeking to use our space for pubic or private industry events to make a donation to the local non-profit <a href="http://byteback.org" target="_blank" />Byte Back<a/>. We strongly recommend that organizers make a minimum donation of $500, or choose an amount that better reflects their abililty to give to this great cause. 

Alternatively, event organizers can choose to run a ticketing structure that allows attendees to set their own donation amount during event registration. This method was used during the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/capitolhop-launch-party-tickets-10153803299?aff=eorg" target="_blank" />Capitol Hop Launch Party<a/> back in January, and as a result, DCTECH raised over $1,000 to help low-income residents of Washington, DC get access to computer training and employment readiness skills.

At nclud, we believe that DCTECH should be more than just a group of companies and individuals building a tech economy to benefit ourselves. We should embrace the mission of Byte Back and ensure that all of our neighbors, in each and every ward, have access to the tools, technology, and training necessary to particpiate and add to the success we have all shared in the DCTECH community.

It's easy to participate in this model of giving, just <a href="http://nclud.com/events/" target="_blank" />register for any public event taking place at nclud<a/>, or step up to program your own event, and be the reason your neighbor is able to join the modern workforce. Where would each of us be without that first introduction to the digital world? It's impossible to know, but we can all agree that each of us is better because of it, and DCTECH will be bettered by supporting Byte Back.
