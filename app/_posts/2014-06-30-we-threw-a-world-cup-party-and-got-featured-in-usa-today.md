With that in mind, it wasn't a surprise that we had a viewing party for the staff and friends of staff. We had a hundred pounds of fruit delivered for smoothies; our usual fully-stocked bar; brats and hot dogs (keeping in line with the USA vs. Germany theme); and another big screen reserved for FIFA on Wii among other party favors.

With the game right in the middle of day, the story touched on how employees are finding ways to get out of work and how some companies are embracing the fact that employees want to watch. The company that was featured was us. Check out the [full story here](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/06/25/soccer-world-cup-fans-work/11354977/).
