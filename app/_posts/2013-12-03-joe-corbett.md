I am pleased to announce that Joe Corbett will be joining the nclud team as our Chief Operating Officer on January 1, 2014.

Joe comes to nclud with a wealth of digital agency experience and will be instrumental in our plans to continue expansion of the company's operations. Having known and trusted Joe for a number of years now, I couldn't be happier about working with a like-minded industry vet at my side. Joe will not be coming alone - as part of the negotiated employment package and talent acquisition, Olive has agreed to join our canine division. Also, the fact that Joe is a fellow nintendo fan certainly helped seal the deal for us here at nclud :)

2013 has been a great year for nclud, and 2014 promises to be even more exciting.
