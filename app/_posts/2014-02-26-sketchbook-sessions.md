<p>We have a rich history of knowledge sharing at nclud – our company is built on the value of fostering community. Our closest colleagues &amp; clients got to know us by spending time in our studio and talking with us. Delivering great content &amp; events has been such a rewarding part of our culture that we’re giving it a name and clearer purpose: <em>Sketchbook Sessions</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sketchbook Sessions</em> will continue our tradition of producing free &amp; open talks that have included speakers like <a target='_blank' href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151426098216103.553192.12294301102">Aaron Draplin</a>, <a target='_blank' href="https://www.facebook.com/nclud/posts/10151655341761103">Ian MacKaye</a>, <a target='_blank' href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152044644821103.1073741844.12294301102">Jon Newman</a>, <a target='_blank' href="https://www.facebook.com/nclud/posts/10151880627066103">El Jefe</a>, &amp; others – yet also hosting inspiring discussions &amp; in-depth presentations by our team members.</p>

<p>As we further the conversation on the convergence of design, technology, and creativity we are taking <em>Sketchbook Sessions</em> national with partners like <a target='_blank' href="http://ga.co/">General Assembly</a>, <a target='_blank' href="https://hootsuite.com/">HootSuite</a>, and more to be announced. Furthermore, sponsorship of these events will fit our <a href="http://sketchbook.nclud.com/byte-back/">model of giving back directly to the community</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I’d like to invite you to the first installment in this series tonight, on the <a target='_blank' href="http://www.meetup.com/Data-Visualization-DC/events/167470262/">Art &amp; Code of Data Visualization</a> with <a target='_blank' href="http://alignedleft.com/">Scott Murray</a> co-presented by <a target='_blank' href="http://www.meetup.com/Data-Visualization-DC/">Data Visualization DC</a>. We’re really excited to present this platform that goes behind the scenes of our company, community, &amp; industry to create an open &amp; creative discourse.</p>
