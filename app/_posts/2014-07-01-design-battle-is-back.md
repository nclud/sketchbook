On Friday, July 18, we are holding our second annual [Design Battle Royale](http://design-battle.com/) and we would like to invite you to join us at [our studio](http://nclud.com/contact/) for an awesome evening of competition (and a some partying too!).

Design Battle Royale features five professional designers competing in four rounds of elimination. Each 10- to 15-minute round has a theme and restrictions, and our esteemed panel of judges will rate designers to eliminate them one by one until a victor is determined. Those interested in competing are asked to tweet a single image that showcases their design chops, and the five competitors will be announced on July 8. The call for participants are now open!

In previous years, this event brought out roughly 200 of our friends in the design and tech community as well as other industries. Whether you are attending or competing, start tweeting with the hashtag [#DesignBattle](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23designbattle&src=typd), and we look forward to seeing you all there.

For more information on attending and competing, check out our [official event](http://design-battle.com/) site. For any interested sponsors, please contact Lahaina Mondo√±edo at [lahaina@nclud.com](mailto:lahaina@nclud.com).
