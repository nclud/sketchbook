Interning for a top digital design agency in the District of Columbia can be an awesome and rewarding experience for just about anybody interested in web development. Local agencies often times need help completing day-to-day tasks and an intern can rapidly pick up applicable skills, preparing them for the “real world,” while giving them hands-on experience in the field of their choice. In this article I will be explaining how to land an internship at a top digital design agency in DC.

### 1. Do Your Resarch

Web development spans a wide range of subjects and if new to the space all these job titles and associated subjects have the potential to be extremely overwhelming.  As a first step to entering the world of web development, I would highly advise you to figure out what you really like to do, find your path, and stick to it. For those who have no clue what specific field they are interested in but know they’d like to get involved, I have provided a few subjects that may be of interest.

- [Front-End or Back-End Developing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends)
- [Growth Hacking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking)
- [User Experience Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design)
- [Graphic Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design)
- [Cms Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)
- [Information Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture)

Another good idea would be to find out the top design agencies to work for in the DC area. By asking around and doing some searching yourself, you will be able to get a good feel for where you would like work and why. Some digital design agencies focus on strong marketing efforts and strategy, while others focus on interactive web applications or user experience.  To save you some time, I have provided some of my favorite DC digital design agencies below:

- [Nclud](http://nclud.com/)
- [iStrategy Labs](http://istrategylabs.com/)
- [Cheif](http://www.mybigchief.com/)
- [Interactive Stratigies](http://www.interactivestrategies.com/)
- [Web Devlopment Groups](http://www.webdevelopmentgroup.com/)
- [Laundromat Design](http://laundromatdesign.com/)

### 2. Get Social

**Meetups**

The DC Tech Community holds several events each week to help you out with just about anything involving technology. From networking to educational events, DC’s tech community can make your transition into a geek seamless.  Using online tools such as [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/) and [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/directory?q=tech+event&loc=Washington%2C+DC), you can easily find events to attend every night, giving you the opportunity to rub shoulders with the best and brightest in the DC Tech Community. Some of my favorite events would have to be [DC Night Owls](http://www.meetup.com/dcnightowls/), [UX Book Club DC](http://www.meetup.com/Washington-DC-UX-Book-Club/) and [Start-Up Grind](http://startupgrind.com/washington-dc/).

**Volunteering**

Volunteering at events is also a great way get to know the top people in the DC Tech Community. Helping out at places like [1776](http://1776dc.com/) and interacting with other designers and developers gave me pretty good insight on what I wanted to learn and the most current web practices and online recourses for me to know.

**Hackathons**

Attending hackathons is great way to get involved and can help you out significantly in getting an internship with a digital design agency.  For those who don’t know, a hackathon is an event that usually spans an entire day where programmers and designers collaborate on software projects.  Participating in a hackathon can be a great opportunity for a novice coder to pick up skills in a short amount of time and have something to show for it. Gaining experience is essential for landing any job or internship, and hackathons can help you build tangible skills and projects that you can add to your resume/portfolio.

**Twitter**

Following top leaders in the DC Tech Community on [twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dctech&src=typd) can be very useful for someone trying to get an internship with a digital design agency in DCTECH. Almost anybody that is somebody in the DCTech Community is actively sharing content on twitter. A lot of this information pertains to the latest tech news and trends that could be helpful to anybody trying to break into the DC tech Community. Another reason why twitter is such a powerful tool is that it is fairly easy to contact just about anybody, no matter how big they are, in real time, and get a response.

### 3. Learn To Code

Learning to code can be extremely helpful when trying to get a digital design internship. In fact, it is usually a requirement to have some skill-set in at least [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). Learning to code can be intimidating at first but with time and effort your skill level can rise quickly. My biggest advice would be to utilize online recourses to pick up skills in you spare time. [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/) are great free resources if you are looking to learn how to code but are limited with cash flow. Some other sites such a [Teamtreehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com), [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/), and [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/) are subscription basted and are relatively affordable and tend to have a little bit more resources to aid you in your learning.

### 4. Build a Portfolio

Building a portfolio is an easy way to gain attention and validate your skills. My biggest advice to someone who just started coding is to take on as many basic projects as you can to help build your portfolio. Once you have created a decent amount of work, you need to have it available in one central location. By displaying your projects online through a an attractive personal website, potential employers can evaluate your skill set and see if you are a good fit for their company.

### 5. Fire Away

Once you have done all the research you can, involved yourself within your community, and you have a presentable body of work, take the time to create a list of all the companies you aspire to work for.  Nothing is out of reach. Once you have your list, try and send out as many emails as you can to those potential employers. Be honest about your capabilities and express your desire to learn even more.

You can also look on online resources like [craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/) and [internships.com](http://www.internships.com/) for potential internships. However, sending a personal email inquiring about an open position was the best approach for me.  Digital Design firms in DC respond relatively quickly and are usually thrilled to take on new interns. The worst they can say is no.

### Conclusion

A year ago I had just purchased my first MacBook. I barely knew what a web developer was, and I had no desire to code or design. But fast-forward a year and I can say I truly found a unique space for me to create.  Interning at a digital design agency has been everything I wanted and more so I encourage anybody interested in the space to get active, so go for it! I know if I can do it, anybody can.
